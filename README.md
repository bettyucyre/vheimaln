<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Did your ban hit you faster than a frost troll, even on a fresh account? Or maybe it follows you across multiple accounts? You might be <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! That means the Valheim overlords have flagged your PC hardware, making it tough to jump back in even with a new character.</p>
