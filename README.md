# How to Get Unbanned on Valheim (2025 Guide) ⚔️

Getting banned from Valheim can feel like being booted from your own Viking village — especially if you’re not sure why. This simple guide will help you figure out why your Valheim account might be banned and how to appeal like a true Norse warrior to get back to your adventures.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban hit you faster than a frost troll, even on a fresh account? Or maybe it follows you across multiple accounts? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! That means the Valheim overlords have flagged your PC hardware, making it tough to jump back in even with a new character.

Using an HWID spoofer can be your secret weapon to sneak back into Valheim if you’re caught in a hardware ban.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check all emails or messages from Valheim or the hosting platform (Steam, etc.) to see the reason. Common ban causes include:
- Using cheats or mods that break the rules  
- Griefing or toxic behavior toward other players  
- Sharing accounts or suspicious activity  

**Pro Viking tip:** Always review the Valheim Terms of Service before firing off an appeal.
